Churn Prediction
-----------------------

Predict whether a customer will churn.
Data of the churn modelling is present  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/filippoo/deep-learning-az-ann).

Problem Description: Customer information such as sex, origin, tenure, age, bank balance, salary and others from a bank is given. The aim is to build a model that can predict which customer is likely to churn from the bank.

The notebook deals with the following:
1. Imbalanced Classes
2. Refresher on the confusion matrix entries and various metrics associated in evaluating the efficacy of an algorithm
3. Use of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristcs) to find a good classifier

Different models are tested for achieving the best classification.
